## Project Overview
In this project, students will develop an algorithm and a Java application to help users find the best route from one location to another on the University of Ghana (UG) campus. This includes considering factors such as shortest distance and optimal arrival time, taking into account traffic conditions. The project will utilize various algorithms and techniques, such as Vogel Approximation Method, Northwest Corner Method, Critical Path Method, as well as searching and sorting algorithms, to determine efficient routes and arrival times.

## Project Objectives
1. Develop an algorithm and a Java application to find the best route from location A to location B on the UG campus.
2. Utilize multiple methods to calculate distance and arrival time, ensuring efficiency and accuracy.
3. Implement sorting algorithms to organize routes based on distance and arrival time.
4. Incorporate a searching algorithm to provide multiple route options for users based on selected landmarks.
5. Enhance algorithm performance using techniques like Divide and Conquer, Greedy, and Dynamic Programming.

## Activities
1. **Algorithm Implementation**: Implement various techniques taught in class, including Vogel Approximation Method, Northwest Corner Method, and Critical Path Method, to determine efficient routes and arrival times.
2. **Distance Calculation**: Demonstrate how distances are obtained from source to destination through all possible routes, using methods like Google Maps or other mapping applications. Explore additional distance calculation algorithms such as:
   - Dijkstra's Algorithm: Find the shortest path between nodes in a graph, considering edge weights (distances) between nodes.
   - Floyd-Warshall Algorithm: Calculate shortest paths between all pairs of nodes in a graph, considering edge weights.
   - A* (A Star) Search Algorithm: Find the shortest path from a start node to a goal node, considering both actual cost and heuristic estimates.
3. **Sorting and Printing Routes**: Sort distances and arrival times to provide users with sorted route options. Utilize sorting algorithms such as Quick Sort or Merge Sort for efficient organization.
4. **Searching Algorithm**: Implement a searching algorithm to allow users to select routes based on landmarks. Provide at least three route options for each selection, with significant landmarks highlighted.
5. **Landmark-based Route Generation**: Enable users to input landmarks and generate routes accordingly. For example, if a user enters "Bank," the system should provide all routes passing through or near a bank to the destination.
6. **Creativity**: Apply Divide and Conquer, Greedy, and Dynamic Programming approaches to optimize the algorithm's performance and enhance user experience.

## Deliverables
1. **Presentation of Algorithms**: Present the algorithms, explaining the techniques used and how they contribute to efficiency.
2. **Java Application**: Develop a user-friendly Java application that incorporates the implemented algorithms, allowing users to easily input locations and landmarks to find optimal routes.

## Project Development Process
### Plans
- The project development team identified the tasks to meet the project's objectives and created milestones to meet the deadline.
- The team researched the best approach, such as the Vogel Approximation Method, to help accomplish the set goals.

### Execution
- Implemented the methods and algorithms as planned, ensuring the work aligned with the project's scope and objectives.

### Management of Risks
- Followed the milestones to handle unforeseen problems.
- The testing team kept a close eye on the project to avoid errors.

### Feedback and Approval
- The testing team provided thorough feedback, raising objections immediately, which helped complete the project on time.

### Deployment
- The compilation team combined individual codes efficiently to create a working application.

## Key Features of the System
- The primary feature is to assist users in finding the most optimal route between two specified locations, ensuring it is the shortest possible distance.

## Algorithms Used and Integration
1. Ensure the node or location being searched for is not empty.
2. Assign appropriate distance values to different locations for the search.
3. Input the desired locations, specifying the source or starting point and the destination.
4. Retrieve the nearby nodes or vertices associated with the given location.
5. Compare the nodes of various vertices to identify the shortest path.
6. Select the path offering the shortest distance to the destination and save it for future use.
7. Add or remove locations and their respective distances as needed.
8. Continue comparing and evaluating nodes until the desired path is discovered.
9. Conclude the program once the shortest path to the destination is found.

## Usage
1. Select the current location from the dropdown list.
2. Select the destination from the dropdown list.
3. Click the "Discover routes" button to find the shortest route.
4. The shortest route will be displayed in the designated area.
5. The estimated distance of the route will be shown below.
6. Optionally, click the "Landmark" button to switch to the LandMarkPage.

## Lessons Learnt
- The shortest route is not only implemented using Dijkstra’s algorithms.
- Vogel’s algorithm is highly effective for transportation problems.
- Teamwork is essential in accomplishing tasks like these.
